        K.G.F: Chapter 2 is a 2022 Indian Kannada-language period action film written and directed by Prashanth Neel,
        and produced by Vijay Kiragandur under the banner Hombale Films. The second instalment in a two-part series, it
        serves as a sequel to the 2018 film K.G.F: Chapter 1. The film stars Yash, Sanjay Dutt, Raveena Tandon, Srinidhi
        Shetty and Prakash Raj. It follows the assassin Rocky, who after establishing himself as the kingpin of the
        Kolar Gold Fields, must retain his supremacy over adversaries and government officials, while also coming to
        terms with his past.

        Produced on a budget of â‚¹100 crore (US$13 million), K.G.F: Chapter 2 is the most expensive Kannada film ever
        made. Neel retained the technicians from its predecessor with Bhuvan Gowda handling the cinematography and Ravi
        Basrur scoring the music for the soundtrack and the film's background. Dutt and Tandon joined the cast in early
        2019, marking the former's Kannada film debut. Portions of the film were shot back-to-back with Chapter 1.
        Principal photography for the rest of the sequences commenced in March 2019, but was halted in February 2020
        owing to the COVID-19 lockdown in India. Filming resumed five months later and was completed in December 2020.
        Locations included Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mysore and Kolar.
    <h3>IMDB rating: 8.8/10</h3>
